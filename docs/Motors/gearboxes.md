# Gearboxes
The most efficient gear for robotics is the *Harmonic Drive*. The unique operating principle allows extremely high reduction ratio in a very compact and lightweight package. The high performance attributes of this gearing technology including zero backlash, high torque, compact size, excellent positional accuracy and repeatability are all a direct result of the unique operating principle.


A [spur gear](https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/gear/spur-gears.html) is a cylindrical toothed gear with teeth that are parallel to the shaft and is used to transfer mechanical motion and control speed, power, and torque between shafts. They are the most popular types of cylindrical gears and have a simple design of straight parallel teeth positioned equally around the circumference of the cylinder barrel.

A [bevel gear](https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/gear/bevel-gear.html) is a toothed rotating machine element used to transfer mechanical energy or shaft power between shafts that are intersecting, either perpendicular or at an angle. This results in a change in the axis of rotation of the shaft power. Aside from this function, bevel gears can also increase or decrease torque while producing the opposite effect on the angular speed.

A [helical gear](https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/gear/helical-gears.html) is a particular kind of simple machine that controls the strength or direction of a force. A gear train is made up of multiple gears that are combined and connected by their teeth. These gear trains allow energy to move from one component of a system to another. High-quality helical gears are necessary for advanced industrial machine gearboxes, which are present in most mechanical manufacturing, fabricating, and construction machinery.

A [worm gear](https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/gear/worm-gears.html) is a staggered shaft gear that creates motion between shafts using threads that are cut into a cylindrical bar to provide speed reduction. The combination of a worm wheel and worm are the components of a worm gear. Speed reduction is determined by the number of worm threads and the number of teeth on the worm wheel.

A [plastic gear](https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/gear/plastic-gears.html) is a toothed wheel made up of engineering plastic materials that work with others to alter the relation between the speed of an engine and the speed of the driven parts. The engineering plastic materials used in manufacturing plastic gears can be nylon, which is essentially polyamide resin, and polyacetal.

[Ball screws](https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/ball-screws.html) are mechanical linear actuators that consist of a screw shaft and a nut that contain a ball that rolls between their matching helical grooves. The primary function of ball screws is to convert rotational motion to linear motion. Ball nuts are used in transmitting forces to a stationary or dynamic load with high accuracy, precision, and repeatability.

A [lead screw](https://www.iqsdirectory.com/articles/ball-screw/lead-screws.html) is a kind of mechanical linear actuator that converts rotational motion into linear motion. Its operation relies on the sliding of the screw shaft and the nut threads with no ball bearings between them. The screw shaft and the nut are directly moving against each other on a large contact area, so higher energy losses due to friction are produced. However, the designs of lead screw threads have evolved to minimize friction.
